    <h1 style="color:coral" align="center"><font size=6> History of Halloween</h1>
    <p2 style="color: chocolate"><font size=5> About the origin of Halloween, various versions, popular <p2><br>
<p3 style="color: darkgoldenrod"> <font size=4>2,000 years ago, the Christian church in Europe designated November 1 as "all saints day." "Hallow" means saint. Legend has it that the Celts, who lived in Ireland and Scotland, moved the festival one day earlier, on October 31. They think of it as the official end of summer, the beginning of the New Year, and the beginning of the harsh winter. At that time, it was believed that the spirits of the dead would return to their former homes on this day to look for life in the living, thereby regenerating, and this is the only hope that people can be reborn after death. And the living are afraid of the ghost of the dead to seize life, so people on this day to extinguish the fire, candlelight, let the ghost of the dead can not find the living, and dressed up as ghosts and ghosts to scare the ghost of the dead away. After that, they would rekindle the fire and candle light to start a New Year's life.</p3><br>
<p4 style="color: darkkhaki"><font size=4>Halloween was originally a celebration of autumn, just as mayday was a celebration of spring. The druid priests of ancient Gaul, Britain and Ireland had a great festival to celebrate autumn, which lasted from midnight on October 31 to November 1 the following day. They thought that on that night their great god of death, saman, had summoned all the ghosts of those who had died that year, and that these evil spirits would be punished by turning themselves into beasts. Of course, as long as the thought of such a gathering of ghosts, it was enough to make those simple-minded stupid people shudder. So they lit bonfires that rose to the sky and kept a close watch on the evil spirits. This is how the story of witches and ghosts all over Halloween began. It is still believed to be true in isolated parts of Europe.
The ancient Romans also had a festival on November 1 to honor their goddess Pomona. They roasted nuts and apples in front of a blazing fire. Our Halloween seems to be a mixture of ancient Roman and druid festivals. </p4>
